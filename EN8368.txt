Chapter 3 Questions
An hour after I talked to Mark Johnson, I was at the University of Colorado Hospital. I got out of the Chevy and walked to the front door. I asked to see Dr. Judy Kaplan.
I waited for about ten minutes. Then Judy came. "Hi, Flick!" she said. "What are you doing here?"
I didn't answer her. I just asked. "Do you have time for coffee?"
"Something wrong?" she asked.
Again, I didn't answer her. 
We went down to the hospital cafeteria. We sat at a small table near the window and crank our coffee. I looked at Judy. I didn't know what to say, I looked out the window at the trees and flowers in the hospital garden.
Then I told Judy about Jack Daly.
"Dead? What...? How...?" said Judy. She closed her eyes.
"I don't know." I said. "He died in his office. I saw him this morning. It looks like he killed himself, but I don't think so.
She opened her eyes again and looked at me. "So you think...?"
"Well," I said, "I don't know."
Judy's face was white. We drank our coffee. We didn't say anything for a minute or two.
"Was Daly happy here?" I asked.


"I don't know." Judy answered. "I think so."
"When did he start at the hospital?" I asked her.
"Only about a year ago," she replied.
"Was there anybody here who didn't like him?" I asked. "I don't think so," she said.
"And before he came here?"
"He was in Florida. I think," she said. "Miami."
I thought about the pictures on the walls of Daly's office. Yes, there was a picture of Miami. 
"At a hospital there?" I asked.
"I don't know," she said. "Look, I'm sorry Flick, but I must go back to work."
Judy stood up and left. I went to the police station. I talked to Leo. I told him what I thought, that Daly didn't kill himself. I told him about the gun in his right hand.
"Well, all right." he said, "but you say Jack Daly was a nice guy. So why did somebody kill him?"
"Good question," I said. I didn't know the answer.
That evening I sat in my apartment and looked at Danny Reno's photos, I looked at Jack Daly's body, looked and looked.
Then I heard the telephone. It was Reno. 
"More news about Jack Daly's body," said Reno. "You were right. Detective. Jack Daly was left-handed. It was Daly's gun but it was in his right hand. He didn't kill himself. It was murder."
"Yeah," I said. "I thought so."
"We found a letter in Daly's office, too."
"A letter"
"That's right," said Reno. "It just says, "You are never going to forget Jeff Baker!""
You are never going to forget Jeff Baker!
The next morning I met Danny Reno ut our office and he gave me the letter. It was in big, black writing. "Do you think it's important?" asked Reno.
"I don't know," I said. I thought about Jack Daly's phone call to me on Monday. Did Daly want to talk to me about the letter?
 I read it again. "You are never going to forger Jeff Baker!"
"The letter was in this," said Reno. He gave me an envelope with Daly's name on it, but not the address of his office.
"Listen, Danny," I said, "I've got a job for you. I want you to look for Jeff Baker. How did Jack Daly know him? I'm sorry; it's not an easy job. There must be hundreds of Jeff Bakers in Colorado. You can start in Denver."
"Sure, Detective," said Reno. "Oh, and here's something about the gun." Reno gave me some papers and left my office.
I started to read. "The gun that killed Dr. Jack Daly," it said, "was a Ruger SP101 and it was Daly's gun. The killer shot the doctor, then cleaned the gun and put it into the dead man's hand."
OK. But where did the killer get Daly's gun? And how did he get into Daly's office? Who was Jeff Baker? And why did Daly want to talk to me?
I had a lot of questions, but no answers. It was the end of August and we didn't have anything. We had nothing on Jeff Baker and we knew nothing about who killed Jack Daly. 
But then the month of August became the month of September, and the answers started to come.


Chapter 4 The key
One evening, two weeks after the murder, Mark Johnson, the office cleaning man, called me.
"Detective Laine," he said. "Can I see you?" "Yes, Mr. Johnson. Sure, What about?"
"You know the Daly murder? Well. I thought of something. You told me to call."
"Good," I said. "Come to Pete's coffee shop near the police station on Washington."
An hour later, Mark Johnson and 1 were at a table at Pete's
"It's about the key," said Johnson.
